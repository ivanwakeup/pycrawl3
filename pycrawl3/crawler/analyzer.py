So it can seem a nightmare finding the best beauty blogs, ones who really know their stuff when it comes to make-up, skincare and the like (we know and we’ve logged the hours on Google to prove it).   But amongst the chaff, there are some seriously brilliant beauty bloggers who know everything from the best foundation for oily skin to the best moisturiser for dry skin . From local grown beauty gurus to international skincare juggernauts, we’ve unearthed the very best of what the beauty blogosphere has to offer.  A Model Recommends    Who   Fashion-model-turned-blogger Ruth Crilly.  Why  As a jobbing-model for over a decade, Crilly really knows what works – particularly what’s going to look great on camera. She launched A Model Recommends in 2010 to share an insight into the life of a model and give everyone access to the same tips and pro techniques that she enjoys on set. You’ll particularly love her video tutorials and, if you’re very lucky, you might catch a glimpse of her dog Dexter being naughty in the background.  Caroline Hirons    Who   Caroline Hirons, aka the skincare oracle.  Why  Seriously, what this woman doesn’t know about skin probably isn’t worth knowing. Hirons is a qualified facialist and brand consultant. Even as beauty editors, we find ourselves rushing out to buy Hirons’ recommendations (she has inspired somewhat of a Tata Harper addiction – but our skin thanks her for it). She began uploading regularly to YouTube a year ago and has already amassed over 82,000 subscribers. Expect brutally, and refreshingly, honest opinions.  The Latest               Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros. UK       This is why you should care about Nagini in Fantastic Beasts                 James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       Lady Gaga was told to get a nose job when she was first starting out                       Hot List: Here’s what’s new in your favourite stores and online this week       Sharethrough (Mobile)         Pixiwoo   Who  Make-up artist sisters and beauty pros, Nic Haste and Sam Chapman, aka Pixiwoo .  Why  With their YouTube channel nearing its 10-year anniversary, the Pixiwoo sisters are currently some of the biggest names in the beauty industry. Their brainchild, RealTechniques, brought some of the best make-up brushes to the high street’s price point, and their video tutorials have racked up millions and millions of views on YouTube (no surprise considering how knowledgeable and fun they are to watch).  Rebecca Fearn  Jana Otte  Who  Beauty journalist, Rebecca Fearn.   Why  A beauty writer, make-up addict and fragrance enthusiast by trade, London-based Becky has a few years’ experience as a beauty insider under her belt. On #BDoesBeauty, she shares her industry knowledge, tips and reviews, as well as the can’t-live-without products that you’ll love too. As well as all things make-up, hair and skincare, she also writes about social issues and current affairs from time to time. A great read.  BeautyAndStyleEdit.com (AKA BASE)   Who:  Fashion stylist Abisoye Odugbesan.  Why:  Maybe you wouldn’t ordinarily think of turning to a fashion stylist for beauty advice but BASE proves exactly why you should. Having worked in the fashion industry for nearly a decade, Abi felt frustrated at the lack of inclusive beauty content addressing all skin tones and hair types. So she developed BASE, to do just that. In just under a year, BASE has already become a go-to destination for women who want a good dose of beauty with a helping of style. There’s plenty of product reviews, interviews and, of course, drool-worthy shoots, to get your hands on.   Madeleine Loves    Who   Beauty editor and product addict Madeleine Spencer.  Why  Beauty obsessive Madeleine has created a one-stop-shop with her newly redesigned Madeleine Loves . From product reviews, book recommendations, fashion titbits, travel suggestions and video tutorials, she’s got you covered. We particularly love ‘The Panic Station’ which addresses mental health and is where Madeleine shares her experience of anxiety. There’s something for everyone.  Sali Hughes Beauty   Who  Make-up artist and Guardian Weekend columnist Sali Hughes.  Why   Sali’s no-nonsense approach to beauty talk makes her someone worth listening to. Author of two beauty bibles, Pretty Honest and Pretty Iconic , she’s much-loved by her readers thanks to her honest opinions and practical advice. And her ‘In The Bathroom With…’ video series is genius. Watch them.  Lisa Eldridge   Who  World-renowned make-up artist Lisa Eldridge.  Why  It’s not just the A-List clientele that has us logging-in repeatedly to Lisa Eldridge’s website – her videos are something that are quite simply not to be missed. Expect a good mix of celebrity ‘Get The Look Features’ like Kendall Jenner’s smoky eyes, to a series of tutorials that cater to the basics from ‘Make-up for Glasses’, to how to get ‘Natural, Flawless Skin’ and – our favourite – ‘Meeting Up With The Ex’ where Lisa demonstrates how to minimise the appearance of puffy ‘cried through the night’ eyes. There’s even the odd cameo by Alexa Chung. You can’t help but learn a thing or two with Lisa and her new book Face Paint: The Story Of Make-Up is a must-have too.  Into The Gloss   Who  Blogger turned business mogul Emily Weiss.  Why  If you do just one thing today make sure it’s logging on to Into The Gloss and checking out The Top Shelf. It will quickly become your lunchtime ritual. ITG began as the brainchild of Emily Weiss (the ‘Super Intern’ from reality TV programme ‘The Hills’). Originally a simple beauty blog, ITG has gone on to become an international business but, despite its crazy success, the site is as much of a joy to read now as it was when it was first launched. The Top Shelf is our favourite feature that takes a nosy into the bathroom cabinets and beauty hoards of some of our favourite well known women. And did we mention she’s the founder of that cult beauty brand, Glossier …?  Huda Beauty    Who   American-born, award-winning beauty blogger and Hollywood-trained make-up artist Huda Kattan, now based in Dubai, UAE. She is the face of HudaBeauty and has since launched her eponymous make-up line of the same name (think the fullest coverage foundation, eye palettes to die for and one of the world’s best lipstick kits, ever).  Why  She’s the queen of YouTube and Instagram beauty-blogging, plus she’s a global beauty mega star and incredibly astute business woman, who has more than 1.5M YouTube subscribers and an impressive 15.9M Instagram followers and 72.6K Twitter followers.  Farah Dhukai    Who   This 28 year-old beauty blogger is from Toronto, Canada and studied cosmetology science at Aveda, before starting her YouTube channel six years ago.  Why  She has 1.3M YouTube subscribers, 4.1M Instagram followers and 33.5K Twitter followers. She also has beauty range, Farsali, with her husband. Consider her the big sister every girl needs advising on DIY beauty, hair and make-up.  Nikkie Tutorials    Who   Nikkie de Jager is fun, zany and an incredibly skilled make-up artist, hailing from the Netherlands.  Why           She creates a base that makes your skin look like it has a photoshop finish. Her collaboration with Too Faced cosmetics saw the release of cult favourite product, The Power of Make-up Palette by NikkieTutorials. Jaclyn Hill   Who  She’s the 26 year-old make-up artist and beauty blogger from America who started her YouTube channel in 2011 and collaborated with Becca cosmetics to produced the hugely popular Champagne Pop highlighter. Why Jaclyn has 3.7m YouTube subscribers, 3.4m Instagram followers and 697.5K Twitter followers . Reading now              Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros.

How do you know what concern to target? How often should you use one, and what’s the right way to apply?   Don’t panic though, we’ve scoured the beauty halls and trialled an almighty selection of the latest offerings to bring you a select edit of the best out there. So you can rest assured that your hard earned pennies are only spent on the ones that really work.  If you’re dubious about the necessity of an eye cream in your regime, consider this: the skin around your peepers is around 40% thinner than the rest of your face, which is why it’s so important to use a cream tailored to the area. It’s this delicacy that makes your eyes prone to crêpe-ness and crows feet long before the rest of your face follows suit.  International Facialist Abigail James explains: ‘the eye area is the most expressionate area of the face, meaning it’s the first place that fine lines appear.’ Not only is skin thinner but research has shown it’s also subjected to ‘repetitive stress from micro-eye movements’ – AKA blinking, which we do on average over 28,000 a day.  Keep scrolling to see our edit of the best eye cream for every concern and, remember: when it comes to application, pat, don’t rub.

They would have played a part in a wedding morning many times before, so their job is to not only make you feel and look amazing, but to also keep you calm while they have you in their hot seat. Recommendations ‘I’ve had many brides through recommendations, but what’s beautiful about it is that you get to know their families and friendship circles well.          For a bride, it feels like you know that make-up artist a little more too, which just allows you to be comfortable with them and will make the wedding morning go even more smoothly.’ With these tips under your belt, you’re sure to find your perfect professional make-up match.

Is it really okay that you’ve held on to the same lipstick for years for those rare occasions you need a bright orange lip? Pencil eyeliners don’t actually have to be chucked until you’ve sharpened it within an inch of its life, right? And what’s wrong with keeping a blusher forever?  But keeping old products can expose us to harmful toxins and cause serious health problems, which is why we’ve pulled together a very handy and in-depth guide to when it’s time to bin your beauty buys.  Read on for your comprehensive guide to the different make-up expiry dates, from powder to concealer, mascara and lipstick…  When does foundation and concealer expire?  When to toss  The life of your foundation depends on its ingredients. A water-based product will last up to 12 months, while oil-based foundations will make it to 18 months because oil is a natural preservative.  Expiry signs  When the oils rise to the top and the consistency thickens, which means that your foundation will create an uneven, streaky and inconsistent finish.  How to protect  You can prevent your foundation from separating by stashing it somewhere cool and regularly shaking the liquid to mix the oils, purified water and make-up particles together. Keep your application tools clean too and avoid touching your foundation as much as possible to keep bacteria at bay.   When does blusher, bronzer and face powder expire?  When to toss  Does powder make-up expire? Definitely yes, and the recommended time to keep it is 18 months. Powder products don’t contain water, so it’s harder to make bacteria grow. Cosmetic chemist Ni’Kita Wilson advises to look out for the ones with botanical extracts such as aloe, green tea extract and chamomile. Wilson explains that oils will cling to the bristles of your brush and transfer to your product when applying powder over liquid or cream face products, which causes a dull grey film on the product.  Expiry signs  Noticed a hard rim on your powder? This is due to minerals in your blush mixing with oils from your skin overtime.  How to protect  Always close your compact or twist the lid shut after use to avoid oxidation, which can change the colour of powders. Also, avoid using an emollient or greasy concealer before you apply. Plus, make sure your brush is always clean before each use to limit the amount of oil that ends up in your powder. Allow to dry and it’s as good as new.  The Latest               Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros. UK       This is why you should care about Nagini in Fantastic Beasts                 James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       Lady Gaga was told to get a nose job when she was first starting out                       Hot List: Here’s what’s new in your favourite stores and online this week       Sharethrough (Mobile)         When does mascara expire?   When to toss  Three months with everyday use and six months with occasional use. Wet environments harbour bacteria, which is why our most-loved beauty product has such a short expiration period. Bacteria also naturally exist on our eyelashes and these germs are transferred from our eyes to our wands and into the mascara tube. In fact, research from two Brazilian university studies found that 79% of mascara samples owned by women are contaminated with staph bacteria.  Expiry signs  If it smells funky, it’s gone off, but trust us, just toss it after three to six months. It might be heartbreaking to see your make-up expire, but binning that mascara now is better for you in the long run.  How to protect  Don’t pump the wand, as it pushes air into the tube, causing it to dry out. Instead, draw it out and twist against the tube’s interior to pick up product. If your mascara dries up,revive with a few drops of baby oil.  When does eyeliner expire?  When to toss  Three months to three years. Liquid eyeliners have the same bacteria-prone formula and packaging as mascaras, whereas pencil eyeliners have greater lasting power because as you sharpen them you remove bacteria that you pick up from using it on your eyes.   Expiry signs  If a white film that can’t be sharpened off develops on your eyeliner, replace it with a brand new one.  How to protect  Limit germs in liquid eyeliner by cleaning the tip after each use. If you use a pencil,regularly sanitise your sharpener with cotton wool and rubbing alcohol to stop bacteria from dwelling on the razor and ending up on your eyeliner.  When does lipstick and lipgloss expire?   When to toss: Lipstick doesn’t hold much bacteria, so it can last between 12 – 18 months. Although lipstick and gloss are packed with preservatives such as parabens, essential oils and vitamins to ward off germs, these naturally start to break down after a year.  Expiry signs: Any beading of moisture, funky smells or chalky texture means it’s time to toss.  How to protect: Store your summer hue in the fridge. Keeping lipstick and gloss away from heat slows the breakdown of ingredients. Also, don’t apply lipstick straight after eating – it cultivates bacteria.   Do makeup brushes expire?  When to toss: Brushes can last a long time if well looked after.  Expiry signs: When the bristles start falling out, that’s when you know it’s time to replace it.           How to protect: Brushes should be washed at least once every two weeks, and try to spot-clean your eye brushes after each use to avoid infections. All you need is warm water, mild soap and a dash of olive oil; give your brush a swirl (the olive oil breaks down the oil in make-up) and rinse thoroughly.

				Credit: Rex         Popular  Popular life stories    Get ready to have the best sex EVER   Ask anyone about tantric sex and they’ll probably tell you the two following things. a) that it’s meant to be amazing and b) that they don’t actually have a clue what it involves. Sure, we’ve all heard the rumours about those steamy sessions which supposedly last for hours on end, but just how much of this is actually true? And if it is, how do we do it?  Here are the answers you’ve been waiting for…    What is tantric sex?    Believed to have originated in India over 5000 years, Tantra is a combination of spirituality and sexuality that lead to enlightenment.  And while it can give you mind-blowing orgasms, this isn’t actually what it’s all about. ‘Tantra is the union of sex, heart and spirit, bringing all of these into not just our sexual experiences but into our life,’ explains sex coach Sarah Rose Bright. ‘It invites us be really conscious about who and how we are as a sexual being.’ But of course the improved sex is a part of this as together, sex and orgasm are believed to equate to the highest level of spiritual awareness.  So, how do I have tantric sex?  Tantra takes time to master, but you know what they say – practice makes perfect. Here are three simple tips for beginners from tantric experts.  1. Make eye contact   Yes, it might sound a bit cringe, but gazing into each other’s eyes is one of the easiest ways of upping the sexual ante.  Start by sitting face-to-face in your partners lap with your eyes closed. Relax your breathing and start rocking towards each other with every inhalation and back on every exhalation. Once you’ve found your rhythm, begin clenching and unclenching your pelvic floor muscles to match your breathing.  The Latest               Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros. UK       This is why you should care about Nagini in Fantastic Beasts                 James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       Lady Gaga was told to get a nose job when she was first starting out                       Hot List: Here’s what’s new in your favourite stores and online this week       Sharethrough (Mobile)         Now open your eyes and stare into your partners. Sure, you might feel a bit stupid at first but if you stick with it, it’ll help you fall in love with each other all over again. ‘It can be the most intimate thing to connect with our eyes and just be in the presence of each other and to see each other in our nakedness without feeling the need to perform,’ explains Sarah Rose Bright. ‘And when we connect with our eyes it cultivates a deeper connection and presence.’  2. Go in for a kiss  As you’re rocking, try to coordinate your breathing so that you’re inhaling as your partner exhales. Now that you’re sharing each breath, kiss each other and visualise how you are sharing all of yourself with your partner. ‘Connect your lips and have a moment in stillness, feel that first contact and the energy between you there,’ advises tantric sex teacher Alexey Kuzmin. It’ll make those kisses so much more intense.  3. Try a simple touch  As we said, tantric sex isn’t all about orgasm, it’s about exploring your sensuality through an erotic build up. Touching and teasing is key, with a focus on making every touch count.  The secret to this is the intention behind it. When you’re busy and stressed, it’s hard to focus on the moment rather than an issue at work/the chores you need to do/the birthday card you need to send. But your partner will sense if you’re distracted and your touch will feel vacant.           So when you start a session, make a concerted effort to clear your mind. ‘Place all of your attention on the pleasure in the here and now,’ advises Sarah Rose Bright. ‘If you find your mind wondering, gently bring your attention back to your pleasure. Rather than pushing to build the arousal, enjoy the natural ebb and flow of arousal. Simply being with it allows your body’s innate wisdom to spring forth. You begin to connect to the sensations in your body in a different way, immersing yourself in the depths of your pleasure.’ If you’re still looking to spice up your sex life, then why not try give one of these best sex toys for couples a try?

Your photo and tagline are only displayed for an hour at a time, which also means you’d better move fast. 3nder (‘Thrinder’)  3nder app How does 3nder work? Always wanted a threesome but never known where to find that special (extra) someone? Well, there’s now a dating app to help you out. 3nder works much like Tinder; log on through Facebook (there’s an option to change your name), choose the composition of your group (2+1, or 1+1+1) and swipe through hundreds of potential matches in your area. Why is 3nder one of the best sex apps? This app has the ease of tinder, and much like that, most of the fun lies in the swiping. Once you’ve matched, how things proceed is up to you. Get Now Mimitate  Mimitate app How does Mimitate work? This app combines selfie-taking with Netflix. What more could we possibly want in 2016? Guys take a selfie and post it along with what they’re watching. If a girl likes both offerings, she fires back a selfie mimicking his, opening up a chat. Why is Mimitate one of the best sex apps? This app eliminates unwanted advances, as you’ll never receive messages unless you show interest by way of your selfie. Plus, it’s a hilarious and ingenious idea. Who knew taking selfies while watching Netflix could lead to so much fun? Get Now Whiplr  Whiplr app How does Whiplr work? This is the app to satisfy all your kinks and fetishes. Getting beyond the small talk it gets down to the nitty-gritty of what you want, what you really, really want. Why is Whiplr one of the best sex apps? You don’t need Facebook to log into this one and can choose a nickname. It’s very specific gender and kink-wise, so the potential is there to find your perfect partner. However, the free service is limited and full use is a costly £14.99/£7.50 a month, monthly/annually. I guess the question is, how much you value your kink? Get Now Bumble  Bumble app How does Bumble work? Bumble calls itself a feminist app; for any matches that happen, the woman must start the chat within 24 hours, or it disappears. Why is Bumble one of the best sex apps? Pressure is high with that time limit – but it helps you quickly figure out whether that guy is worth the initial message. Get Now Wingman  Wingman app How does Wingman work? Going on holiday? Who cares what’s at the end of the plane journey, with this app the fun starts before you even land. Wingman lets you connect with others on your flight, giving you the chance for a sneaky in-flight get-together. Why is Wingman one of the best sex apps? We’re not sure how likely it is that there’s someone fanciable on your flight who also has this app. But if you want to start your holiday romance before you’ve even left UK airspace, it’s probably the best place to start. Get Now Her  How does Her work? Forget Grindr, Her is a hook-up app for LGBTQ women, by LGBTQ women. While it sells itself as more of a lesbian/bi/trans community rather than a dating platform, it’s one of the most popular apps for the audience in the entire world. Beyond meeting other like-minded individuals, you’ll also be able to find out about gay-friendly news and events going on in your area so you can take things offline. Why is Her one of the best sex apps? There aren’t enough apps out there for our LGBTQ sisters and as far as they go, this is one of the best. We love the news and events updates too. Happn  How does Happn work? If you want the magic of a meet-cute alongside your one night stand, Happn is a good bet. It started out in France back in 2015, but it’s quickly picked up speed around the world.  The way it works is this: after you’ve finished setting up your profile, it tracks where you and other users have crossed paths – as well as how many times it’s happened (or happnd). It functions the same way as a match and you can strike up a conversation with them on the app. Why is Happn one of the best sex apps?     We really love the concept of Happn and there’s some mighty fine talent on there. Its 250m radius is awesome for big sprawling cities like London, but if you’re somewhere like Leamington Spa then the pool’s going to dry up quick. Get Now How do you stay safe using the best sex apps? And now, the serious bit. Meeting up with total strangers is not a risk-free exercise, and more so if the prospect of having no strings sex is on the cards.  Avoid revealing your exact location, keep it vague or change your address.  Do a background check on Twitter and type their name into google to pull up further info on them.  Speak on the phone before meeting to get an idea of their personality.  Look for inconsistencies, such as where they say they live or what they do. If you think they are lying. Make your excuses and cut contact.  Go with your instinct and gut feeling.  Always arrange to meet in a public place during the day.  Have your own transportation.  Let a friend know exactly where you are meeting and make them check in with you by text a couple of hours in to check all is ok.
