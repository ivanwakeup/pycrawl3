So it can seem a nightmare finding the best beauty blogs, ones who really know their stuff when it comes to make-up, skincare and the like (we know and we’ve logged the hours on Google to prove it).   But amongst the chaff, there are some seriously brilliant beauty bloggers who know everything from the best foundation for oily skin to the best moisturiser for dry skin . From local grown beauty gurus to international skincare juggernauts, we’ve unearthed the very best of what the beauty blogosphere has to offer.  A Model Recommends    Who   Fashion-model-turned-blogger Ruth Crilly.  Why  As a jobbing-model for over a decade, Crilly really knows what works – particularly what’s going to look great on camera. She launched A Model Recommends in 2010 to share an insight into the life of a model and give everyone access to the same tips and pro techniques that she enjoys on set. You’ll particularly love her video tutorials and, if you’re very lucky, you might catch a glimpse of her dog Dexter being naughty in the background.  Caroline Hirons    Who   Caroline Hirons, aka the skincare oracle.  Why  Seriously, what this woman doesn’t know about skin probably isn’t worth knowing. Hirons is a qualified facialist and brand consultant. Even as beauty editors, we find ourselves rushing out to buy Hirons’ recommendations (she has inspired somewhat of a Tata Harper addiction – but our skin thanks her for it). She began uploading regularly to YouTube a year ago and has already amassed over 82,000 subscribers. Expect brutally, and refreshingly, honest opinions.  The Latest               Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros. UK       This is why you should care about Nagini in Fantastic Beasts                 James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       Lady Gaga was told to get a nose job when she was first starting out                       Hot List: Here’s what’s new in your favourite stores and online this week       Sharethrough (Mobile)         Pixiwoo   Who  Make-up artist sisters and beauty pros, Nic Haste and Sam Chapman, aka Pixiwoo .  Why  With their YouTube channel nearing its 10-year anniversary, the Pixiwoo sisters are currently some of the biggest names in the beauty industry. Their brainchild, RealTechniques, brought some of the best make-up brushes to the high street’s price point, and their video tutorials have racked up millions and millions of views on YouTube (no surprise considering how knowledgeable and fun they are to watch).  Rebecca Fearn  Jana Otte  Who  Beauty journalist, Rebecca Fearn.   Why  A beauty writer, make-up addict and fragrance enthusiast by trade, London-based Becky has a few years’ experience as a beauty insider under her belt. On #BDoesBeauty, she shares her industry knowledge, tips and reviews, as well as the can’t-live-without products that you’ll love too. As well as all things make-up, hair and skincare, she also writes about social issues and current affairs from time to time. A great read.  BeautyAndStyleEdit.com (AKA BASE)   Who:  Fashion stylist Abisoye Odugbesan.  Why:  Maybe you wouldn’t ordinarily think of turning to a fashion stylist for beauty advice but BASE proves exactly why you should. Having worked in the fashion industry for nearly a decade, Abi felt frustrated at the lack of inclusive beauty content addressing all skin tones and hair types. So she developed BASE, to do just that. In just under a year, BASE has already become a go-to destination for women who want a good dose of beauty with a helping of style. There’s plenty of product reviews, interviews and, of course, drool-worthy shoots, to get your hands on.   Madeleine Loves    Who   Beauty editor and product addict Madeleine Spencer.  Why  Beauty obsessive Madeleine has created a one-stop-shop with her newly redesigned Madeleine Loves . From product reviews, book recommendations, fashion titbits, travel suggestions and video tutorials, she’s got you covered. We particularly love ‘The Panic Station’ which addresses mental health and is where Madeleine shares her experience of anxiety. There’s something for everyone.  Sali Hughes Beauty   Who  Make-up artist and Guardian Weekend columnist Sali Hughes.  Why   Sali’s no-nonsense approach to beauty talk makes her someone worth listening to. Author of two beauty bibles, Pretty Honest and Pretty Iconic , she’s much-loved by her readers thanks to her honest opinions and practical advice. And her ‘In The Bathroom With…’ video series is genius. Watch them.  Lisa Eldridge   Who  World-renowned make-up artist Lisa Eldridge.  Why  It’s not just the A-List clientele that has us logging-in repeatedly to Lisa Eldridge’s website – her videos are something that are quite simply not to be missed. Expect a good mix of celebrity ‘Get The Look Features’ like Kendall Jenner’s smoky eyes, to a series of tutorials that cater to the basics from ‘Make-up for Glasses’, to how to get ‘Natural, Flawless Skin’ and – our favourite – ‘Meeting Up With The Ex’ where Lisa demonstrates how to minimise the appearance of puffy ‘cried through the night’ eyes. There’s even the odd cameo by Alexa Chung. You can’t help but learn a thing or two with Lisa and her new book Face Paint: The Story Of Make-Up is a must-have too.  Into The Gloss   Who  Blogger turned business mogul Emily Weiss.  Why  If you do just one thing today make sure it’s logging on to Into The Gloss and checking out The Top Shelf. It will quickly become your lunchtime ritual. ITG began as the brainchild of Emily Weiss (the ‘Super Intern’ from reality TV programme ‘The Hills’). Originally a simple beauty blog, ITG has gone on to become an international business but, despite its crazy success, the site is as much of a joy to read now as it was when it was first launched. The Top Shelf is our favourite feature that takes a nosy into the bathroom cabinets and beauty hoards of some of our favourite well known women. And did we mention she’s the founder of that cult beauty brand, Glossier …?  Huda Beauty    Who   American-born, award-winning beauty blogger and Hollywood-trained make-up artist Huda Kattan, now based in Dubai, UAE. She is the face of HudaBeauty and has since launched her eponymous make-up line of the same name (think the fullest coverage foundation, eye palettes to die for and one of the world’s best lipstick kits, ever).  Why  She’s the queen of YouTube and Instagram beauty-blogging, plus she’s a global beauty mega star and incredibly astute business woman, who has more than 1.5M YouTube subscribers and an impressive 15.9M Instagram followers and 72.6K Twitter followers.  Farah Dhukai    Who   This 28 year-old beauty blogger is from Toronto, Canada and studied cosmetology science at Aveda, before starting her YouTube channel six years ago.  Why  She has 1.3M YouTube subscribers, 4.1M Instagram followers and 33.5K Twitter followers. She also has beauty range, Farsali, with her husband. Consider her the big sister every girl needs advising on DIY beauty, hair and make-up.  Nikkie Tutorials    Who   Nikkie de Jager is fun, zany and an incredibly skilled make-up artist, hailing from the Netherlands.  Why           She creates a base that makes your skin look like it has a photoshop finish. Her collaboration with Too Faced cosmetics saw the release of cult favourite product, The Power of Make-up Palette by NikkieTutorials. Jaclyn Hill   Who  She’s the 26 year-old make-up artist and beauty blogger from America who started her YouTube channel in 2011 and collaborated with Becca cosmetics to produced the hugely popular Champagne Pop highlighter. Why Jaclyn has 3.7m YouTube subscribers, 3.4m Instagram followers and 697.5K Twitter followers . Reading now              Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros.

If you find yourself struggling to maintain normal life in those painful days leading up to payday, this one’s for you. Nothing makes you feel more like a real grown adult than having a savings account that extends past a swear jar or money box.  We consulted the experts at Money Supermarket and Monzo to find out just where we can be spending less and saving more…   Ways to save money  Don’t auto-renew your direct debits  ‘Auto-renewing your car and home insurance, phone tariff, energy bills etc is easy to do – you just let your existing insurance company roll you over onto a new policy. But doing so could see you fork out £100s more a year if you’re not on the most competitive deal on the market – and it’s simple to run a quick search on our comparison tables.  Change your broadband package  ‘If your broadband provider has told you it’s putting up prices, the good news is you have 30 days from when your provider informed you to cancel your contract penalty-free. This applies even if you are mid-way through your contract, so long as you took it out after January 24, 2014. What’s more, as of October 31, 2016, broadband providers have had to make advertising clearer so that customers can compare prices more easily.’  Use your library  ‘When was the last time you set foot in a library? If it’s been a while, take the time to pop in and sign up. Think of the money you’ll save on children’s books, cookbooks, the latest bestsellers… the list is endless!’  Get rid of excess weight in your car  ‘Did you know that for every extra 25kg in weight your car is carrying, fuel consumption will rise by 1%? So check what’s in the boot and get rid of anything you don’t need.’  Consider a SIM-only deal  ‘If you’re not tied in to a contract and you’re happy with your mobile phone, it makes sense to switch to a SIM-only deal. Many SIM-only deals are on a one-month rolling contract, which means you can leave with just 30 days’ notice, and they are often significantly cheaper than longer term tariffs.’  The Latest               Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros. UK       This is why you should care about Nagini in Fantastic Beasts                 James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       Lady Gaga was told to get a nose job when she was first starting out                       Hot List: Here’s what’s new in your favourite stores and online this week       Sharethrough (Mobile)         Shift debt interest-free  Paying interest on a credit card? Shift it to a 0% balance transfer card and you could enjoy up to three years or more interest-free. Bear in mind you’ll usually have to pay a fee to transfer your balance and you’ll need to clear your debt before the interest-free window ends, or you’ll be clobbered with a painful rate of interest. The very best deals are reserved for those with a good credit score.’  Take a healthy packed lunch to work  ‘We all know that spending £5 a day on lunch can add up to around £100 a month, or £1,200 a year, but it can be a struggle to feel motivated enough to whip up a lunch the night before and bring it into work every day.’  Commute by train? Buy a season ticket  ‘If you regularly commute by train, buying a season ticket is the cheapest way to travel. And if you haven’t already, it’s worth checking whether your employer offers a season ticket loan scheme (many do) whereby you take an interest-free loan from your employer to cover the cost of your season ticket, and a monthly amount is then taken from your salary to repay the loan.’  Commute by car? Share a lift  ‘If you travel in to work by car, see whether any of your colleagues live close by and consider lift-sharing. Designate one of you as the driver and split the cost of petrol, or take it in turns to drive.’  Get a water meter  ‘Are there more or the same number of bedrooms in your home as occupants? If so, it could be worth getting a water meter installed. To find out whether it’s worth it and how much you could save, take a look at the Consumer Council for Water’s handy calculator .’   Get a better current account  ‘Whether you’re paying fees for using your overdraft or you religiously stay in the black, switching current accounts could see you much better off. Some current accounts offer interest and fee-free overdrafts, while others will pay interest on in-credit balances. Some also offer tasty cash incentives for switching.’  Get cheaper life insurance  ‘If you have life insurance but haven’t reviewed your policy lately, you could be paying too much. Policies can start from just £5 a month, so it’s worth shopping around to see if you can get a better deal.’  Opt for pay-as-you-go gym membership  ‘New Year is when many gyms offer ‘tempting’ membership deals – but resist signing up for long contracts unless you’re self-disciplined enough to go most days. A more cost-effective option is likely to be pay-as-you-go membership. Many gyms now offer 1-day, 30-day or 60-day passes which won’t leave you out of pocket or racked with guilt if you don’t go for a while.’  Stock up on Christmas gifts in the sales  ‘The last thing you probably want to think about right now is Christmas 2017. But planning ahead and stocking up on Christmas (and birthday) presents in the sales throughout the year will not only save you money, you’ll also feel a little smug when December comes around.’  Stop smoking   ‘Smoking 20 cigarettes a day could be costing you around £270 a month or £3,240 a year. That’s a lot of money going up in smoke. The NHS website offers support for those looking to quit the habit.  Keep track of outgoings by category           There’s a bunch of little expenditures that can quickly add up. Use a spreadsheet or an app like Monzo that automatically categorises your expenditure to see where your money is really going. Get friends to pay you back Don’t let friends keep using you as a bank. Ask them to pay you back when you bought them lunch or a drink. Don’t get ripped off with travel money Don’t leave your travel money to the last minute. Use a card that gives you great rates when you travel. Reading now              Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros.

We’ve all heard of Catfishing – when someone invents a fake persona while online dating , luring people into a relationship or a meeting under false pretences.  While most of us have worried about getting Catfished on our various Tinder or Bumble dates, it is pretty rare for cases to be so extreme and it only happens to very few people.   There is however a new online dating trend to watch out for and it’s something that we’ve all probably experienced without even knowing it.  Introducing Kittenfishing, a watered down form of Catfishing that nearly all of us have either experienced or done ourselves. Yes, really.   So what exactly is it? While Catfishing involves taking on a whole new identity, Kittenfishing is on a much smaller scale, with the concept involving misrepresenting your appearance while online dating.  While you may think, ‘I’ve never done that’ or ‘that’s never happened to me’, you might want to think again. Kittenfishing can range from anything from lying about your job and age to leading people to make false assumptions about your height and weight.

Well don’t be as, for the first time since 1947, the birth rate of women aged 40 and over has surpassed that of women aged 20 and under.  According to the Office for National Statistics, the older age category had the biggest percentage increase in fertility rates in 2015 after rising 3.4%.   As a result, the fertility rate amongst forty-somethings has more than trebled since 1981, reaching its highest point in almost 70 years.  Meanwhile, the category of women aged under-20 had the largest percentage decrease, falling 7.1% as the number of teenage pregnancies continued to decline. So why the upwards age trend?  According to the report: ‘In most developed countries, women have been increasingly delaying childbearing to later in life, which has resulted in rising fertility rates among older women. This may be due to a number of factors such as increased female participation in higher education and the labour force, the increasing importance of a career, the rising costs of childbearing, labour market uncertainty and housing factors.  ‘Rising fertility rates at older ages have affected the average age of mothers, which has been increasing since 1975, reaching 30.3 years in 2015.’  Despite this increase in older mothers , it is still women aged 30-34 who have the highest fertility rate of any group, notching up 111 births per 1000 women. So while the chances of getting pregnant later are improving, you still have a better chance of conceiving under the age of 35.  The Latest               Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros. UK       This is why you should care about Nagini in Fantastic Beasts                 James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       Lady Gaga was told to get a nose job when she was first starting out                       Hot List: Here’s what’s new in your favourite stores and online this week       Sharethrough (Mobile)         According to the NHS: ‘The age at which women first become mothers in the UK is continuing to rise, but as women get older the number and quality of egg cells that are produced by the ovaries declines. [As a result] both mothers and babies face an increased risk of pregnancy-related complications and health problems.’  The message is simple: you’re better off getting pregnant before the age of 35 but if it doesn’t happen, don’t sweat it. Your chances of getting pregnant in your 40s is now better than ever.  Should I take a fertility test?   ‘There is no ‘magic number’ at which female fertility declines but we know that eggs deteriorate with age,’ says Infertility Network UK’s deputy chief executive Susan Seenan.  ‘The speed of that deterioration will vary but rises more steeply after the age of about 35. The more “fertility aware” you are the better, so you can make an informed decision and be aware that it might take you longer to conceive,’ she adds. You could also try using a fertility calculator to better track your chances of conception.  It’s probably best to find out how fertile you are by getting tested. ‘Each woman is different when it comes to fertility and we can now use blood tests and ultrasound scans to see the fertility potential by looking at egg reserves,’ explains Zita. ‘The more egg reserves you have the better your fertility, however this won’t tell us about the quality of the eggs,’ she warns.   One of the biggest issues with getting pregnant later on is that your eggs could be damaged. ‘Older eggs are likely to be chromosomally abnormal, especially if you are in your forties,’ says Zita.  As well as this, it may take longer to conceive as you age. ‘On average, it can take up to a year to conceive [in your forties], so you need to look ahead and start earlier bearing this in mind,’ she adds. ‘The older you are, the greater the chance of having other factors that will hinder conception too.’  According to the NHS, around one third of couples in which the woman is over 35 will experience fertility problems, and this rises to two-thirds when the woman is over 40. But that still means that lots of women in the 35+ age bracket are getting pregnant easily.           The best things you can do to try to protect your fertility and prolong your chances of conceiving later on are getting checked regularly for STIs (chlamydia and gonorrhoea can damage your fallopian tubes), maintaining a healthy weight, drinking sensibly and avoiding smoking. Look after yourself and your sexual health and there’s no reason that you can’t have a happy and healthy pregnancy in your forties.

As people of Britain, it’s our God-given right to indulge our sweet tooth in lavish surroundings at least once a year as part of the sacred ritual that is High Tea.  From tiny sandwiches cut into squares (never triangles – please) to cherry-topped desserts and immaculate white-gloved waiters, here are the best places to have afternoon tea in London.  Afternoon Tea at the Corinthia Hotel, Westminster   The Corinthia has always been one of our fave hotels in London, mainly due to the fact we have collectively interviewed many an A-list face within the hallowed walls of this hotel, but don’t let its starry reputation fool you, it is one of THE most welcoming hotels in the capital. Case in point, the afternoon tea – where the staff are not just well informed and friendly, but also very generous with the portions. Want more tea? No problem. Extra sandwiches? You betcha! Yes, unlike some afternoon teas where there are sandwich rations aplenty, afternoon tea at the Corinthia is a plentiful affair.  Taking place in the grand Crystal Moon Lounge (!), with a background buzz of live piano and happy patrons, you will experience the tastiest pastries and cakes and finest teas around (don’t forget to try their bespoke house infusion). Our tip? Opt in for a flute of Laurent-Perrier Champagne, because nothing is more decadent than sipping on fizz  whilst eating a finger sandwich.  Book now  Afternoon Tea at St. James’s Hotel and Club, Mayfair   Tucked away in a back street behind the Ritz in the heart of London’s Mayfair sits one of London’s best kept secrets: afternoon tea at the St. James’s Hotel & Club . The venue is an institution, renowned for its lush interiors and unique art collection, and is more like stepping into the dining room of a posh Georgian townhouse than a hotel, a real refuge from a day’s shopping in London’s West End. The menu includes bespoke Victorian-themed cakes, scones, sandwiches and teas inspired by the 1840s, the decade in which Afternoon Tea was born. Offerings includes St James Ham and Alberts Chutney, Ox Tongue with Mustard Butter sandwiches, home-made Cheshire Cheese Scones, and Victoria Sponge and Lemon Drizzle cakes to finish. The quality is just what you’d expect from one of Europe’s smallest Michelin-starred restaurants. Visit this Mother’s Day for a special treat. The hotel, which has partnered with the luxury pearl experts, PLAX Jewellery is offering a glass of champagne each, and a unique gift of a pair of handmade  pearl earrings alongside your scones.  Alexander Hamilton Afternoon Tea, The Lanesborough   In the heart of Knightsbridge, The Lanesborough hotel’s newly launched Alexander Hamilton Afternoon Tea is just as much of a hit as its musical namesake. Served in the Michelin-starred Céleste dining room, guests are treated to brand new pastry creations inspired by the Broadway smash and created by Head Pastry Chef Gabriel Le Quang.  On top of these incredible pastries, get ready to enjoy scones still warm from the oven, sumptuous finger sandwiches (including the best coronation chicken you will ever taste), a huge range of teas and of course, a glass of champagne to top it all off.  We loved the exotic lace cupcake and the blackberry cheesecake and, as nothing is too much trouble for The Lanesborough team, gluten-free guests can enjoy equally delicious tea-time treats. As they say in the show, ‘you’ll be back!’  Afternoon Tea Dance, Waldorf Hilton   This tea has it all (champagne, Charleston and a bonafide jazz band). Set in the 1908 Waldorf Hilton ’s airy Palm Court, dancing duo The Twin Swing will treat you to a silver-sequinned display of classic 1920s dance, accompanied by the Berkeley Square Society Band . When the girls aren’t doing their thing, the marble floor is free for the tea-takers (cue adorable older couples waltzing across the dance floor). After a tea of warm scones, finger sandwiches and delicate cakes, there is an (optional) dance lesson where you can try your luck at the Charleston (warning: you may come away with heightened sympathy for contestants on Strictly), followed by more jazz tunes. This is an afternoon excursion that will warm your heart, leaving you pleasantly full, and possibly a little breathless.  Japanese Afternoon Tea, Sosharu   Escape from Britain for a little while and head out east to Sosharu , which offers a gorgeous Japanese take on an English classic. Combining traditional Japanese desserts such as taiyaki, a fish shaped pastry filled with cream, and creating new staples such as matcha iced fingers, the entire selection stems around the ritual of tea ceremony. Of course, you can’t have afternoon tea without said drink and the tea list is long – as well as the cocktail list.  Summer Garden Afternoon Tea, Strand Palace Hotel  Revamped especially for the summer, the culinary team over at Strand Palace Hotel have revised their classic afternoon tea and made it a little more summer-friendly. The entire set is a stroll through a British garden, with floral touches such as white chocolate roses and milk chocolate butterflies. You can’t go wrong with the savouries either and they put a little spin on the standards – think sirloin steak and horseradish served on orange bread and smoked salmon and cream cheese on charcoal toast.  Designer Afternoon Tea, Thomas’ Cafe at Burberry   Head to the Burberry flagship store on Regent Street to delight in a truly British offering at Thomas’ Cafe – primed and ready for Instagram. With all the classic staples like delicate finger sandwiches, scones and a selection of miniature desserts including lemon drizzles and apple choux buns, it’s all served on a vintage-chic brass cake stand. It also washes down a little easily with a complimentary glass of sparkling rose, which might make perusing their store slightly dangerous.   The Savoy, The Strand     Afternoon tea at The Savoy is practically an institution and their beautiful glass domed Thames Foyer is the perfect setting for it. Their multi-course treat features savoury delights such as a selection of finger sandwiches ranging from the staple egg salad to mozzarella, tomato and pesto options. It wouldn’t be a proper afternoon tea without some tea and scones, which come with a hefty helping of clotted cream, lemon curd and preserve to slather on top. Curated by their Executive Pastry Chef Ludwig Hely, there’s a delightful selection of desserts – think raspberry macarons, tiramisu eclairs and more.  Mad Hatter’s Afternoon Tea, Sanderson London   Take a tumble down Fitzrovia’s rabbit hole to Sanderson Hotel ‘s courtyard garden, where you’ll be treated to a smorgasbord of Alice in Wonderland inspired treats, including a chessboard gateau, a chocolate and pistachio blue caterpillar, an apple, cinnamon and peach ‘Drink Me’ potion, alongside Tweedle Dee’s lemon curd financier. A guaranteed crowd-pleaser for literary fans, each addition is inspired by key characters and chapters from the Wonderland books, served with “Alice” China black tea, (or something stronger if you prefer). It looks so good that you’ll almost have trouble finishing it off (emphasis on ‘almost’). Follow the white rabbit for directions.   Jazz Afternoon Tea, Sheraton Grand London Park Lane     Get inspired by 20s London with this Jazz Afternoon Tea served in the art deco surroundings of the Sheraton Grand’s Palm Court. This musically inspired tea is available for 90 days from April 30th (International Jazz Day) to celebrate the hotel’s 90th anniversary, and is accompanied by live jazz. It arrives in a bird cage – an homage to the unique structure of the 1920’s hotel. Highlights include the edible saxophone atop a chocolate tart, and the pinacolada crème topped with a musical note. There’s a veggie sandwich option too, and of course champagne and fresh fruit juice on offer. As for the tea, there are 27 flavours from which to choose – we recommend the Passion Fruit Ceylon from Sri Lanka.   The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Chelsea Marina   The great thing about this tea is it gives you harbour-side views without having to leave London. The Chelsea Harbour Hotel has partnered with Whittard of Chelsea , bringing the world-famous 130-year-old tea brand back to its roots. They offer a curated selection of traditional, herbal and speciality teas, which you can leave to brew while enjoying the repertoire of the live pianist. The scones and sandwiches are as delicious as you’d expect, but don’t forget to save space for the sweeter treats – the mini bakewell tart and red velvet cupcakes being the ones to look out for. And at just £22 per person, it’s affordable too. Go on a sunny day to get the best views over the marina.  The Balcon at the Sofitel London St James   High Tea with a difference – think traditional afternoon tea but with a classic French twist. The Balcon serve traditional Dammann Frères tea (which dates back to 1692 when tea was exclusively sold in France by Monsier Damame), accompanied by a delicious array of finger sandwiches and cakes, as well as Parisienne pastries. If you wish, opt for a glass of champagne or signature cocktail – or opt for 90 minutes of free-flowing champagne for an afternoon of decadence. Taking children out for their first afternoon tea experience? The adorable children’s version comes in a paintbox with an accompanying colouring kit.  Balthazar, Covent Garden  Cake lovers and beauty junkies (so everyone then), this one’s for you! To celebrate 25 years of Bobbi Brown, the beauty brand has collaborated with Balthazar to bring you chocolate treats reminiscent of all your favourite products, alongside their traditional afternoon tea menu. Expect champagne infused Shimmer Bricks and Pot Rouge macaroons.  The Bulgari Hotel, Knightsbridge   If you’re less of a ‘chintz’ person (and you fancy a spin around Harrods afterwards) try the ultra-sleek Bulgari Hotel’s festive afternoon tea . The menu includes a nod to the hotel’s Italian roots with mini panettone, while there are other Christmassy flavours in the orange and winter spiced macaroons. If you’re feeling seriously decadent, you can even add a glass of Ruinart champagne.  The Latest               Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros. UK       This is why you should care about Nagini in Fantastic Beasts                 James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       Lady Gaga was told to get a nose job when she was first starting out                       Hot List: Here’s what’s new in your favourite stores and online this week       Sharethrough (Mobile)         Hotel Cafe Royal, Mayfair  A quintessentially British choice. Hosted at the hotel’s Oscar Wilde bar, the Royal Tea offers an insight into the history of the tradition, followed by a London-themed menu including strawberry jam roly-poly, their Queen of Heart’s Bakewell Tart, and of course, a choice of custom-blend teas.  Mr Fogg’s, Mayfair   Looking to sip on something a bit stronger than a cup of Earl Grey? Mr Fogg’s is the place. A cocktail menu, a hidden location and a new botanical garden make it a top choice for those looking to indulge their inner-glutton in style. If you’re a gin fiend, you’re in for a treat with their bottomless gin tea.  Muriel’s Kitchen, Soho   Banoffee pie jars, brownie bites and little carrot loafs all accompany the usual suspects at cute Muriel’s Kitchen which is known for its healthy but hearty food. We suggest hitting the Soho branch for cake and Prosecco before heading out to the shops for a bit of tipsy retail therapy.   La Suite West, Hyde Park   This is one of very few vegan afternoon teas in London – at La Suite West’ s  Nosh Garden Kitchen the cream is coconut and the cream cheese is cashew nut. If you haven’t got on board with the whole vegan thing don’t be put off, because there’s plenty here to please. (The chocolate brownie and home-made cinnamon scones are a particular highlight). Plus, it can be enjoyed al-fresco in the hotel’s garden terrace, alongside a tea of your choice or a passion fruit and vanilla lychee mocktail (perfect if you’re trying to cut down on the booze too).  The Modern Pantry, Clerkenwell   If you’re looking for insta-worthy food, The Modern Pantry has got it. Sip on a flute of bubbles while munching on some classics with an innovative twist, like their roast chicken, red pepper, wild garlic pesto and sweet chilli mayo sandwiches.  Bluebird Chelsea, King’s Road   Been watching too many Made in Chelsea re-runs? Then get the whole thing out of your system with a calorie blow out at Bluebird Chelsea, a regular haunt of cast and a great little spot for some people watching. Located on the King’s Road, the first floor restaurant serves a Traditional Afternoon Tea with finger sandwiches, scones and lashings of clotted cream. Jolly good.    Amorino, Fulham   Scones not your thing? Artisan gelato and sorbet specialist, Amorino are all about the ice cream. Expect gelato-filled macaroons, gelato roses, refreshing sorbetti drinks and rich Italian hot chocolate to mark the opening of their new Fulham venue.  Sketch, Oxford Circus    Sketch is probably the name on most people’s lips when you ask for a high tea recommendation. Step into the pink parlour, which is decorated by the work of David Shrigley, for an endless supply of tiny, tiny finger sandwiches and fantastical cakes. Before you leave, take a detour to the loos where you can powder your nose in a giant egg-shaped capsule. We’ll leave you with that thought.  Aqua Shard, London Bridge           Not just a delicious menu and some of the best views in the capital, Aqua Shard also offers a glorious nostalgia trip in the form of afternoon tea. As a tribute to the iconic children’s author, Roald Dahl, you can enjoy a selection of novel delicacies from James’ giant peach (meringue) to Mr Twit’s bird pie. In case you were wondering, Snozzcumbers didn’t make the cut. Reading now              Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros.
