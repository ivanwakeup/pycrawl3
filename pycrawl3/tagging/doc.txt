So it can seem a nightmare finding the best beauty blogs, ones who really know their stuff when it comes to make-up, skincare and the like (we know and we’ve logged the hours on Google to prove it).   But amongst the chaff, there are some seriously brilliant beauty bloggers who know everything from the best foundation for oily skin to the best moisturiser for dry skin . From local grown beauty gurus to international skincare juggernauts, we’ve unearthed the very best of what the beauty blogosphere has to offer.  A Model Recommends    Who   Fashion-model-turned-blogger Ruth Crilly.  Why  As a jobbing-model for over a decade, Crilly really knows what works – particularly what’s going to look great on camera. She launched A Model Recommends in 2010 to share an insight into the life of a model and give everyone access to the same tips and pro techniques that she enjoys on set. You’ll particularly love her video tutorials and, if you’re very lucky, you might catch a glimpse of her dog Dexter being naughty in the background.  Caroline Hirons    Who   Caroline Hirons, aka the skincare oracle.  Why  Seriously, what this woman doesn’t know about skin probably isn’t worth knowing. Hirons is a qualified facialist and brand consultant. Even as beauty editors, we find ourselves rushing out to buy Hirons’ recommendations (she has inspired somewhat of a Tata Harper addiction – but our skin thanks her for it). She began uploading regularly to YouTube a year ago and has already amassed over 82,000 subscribers. Expect brutally, and refreshingly, honest opinions.  The Latest               Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros. UK       This is why you should care about Nagini in Fantastic Beasts                 James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       Lady Gaga was told to get a nose job when she was first starting out                       Hot List: Here’s what’s new in your favourite stores and online this week       Sharethrough (Mobile)         Pixiwoo   Who  Make-up artist sisters and beauty pros, Nic Haste and Sam Chapman, aka Pixiwoo .  Why  With their YouTube channel nearing its 10-year anniversary, the Pixiwoo sisters are currently some of the biggest names in the beauty industry. Their brainchild, RealTechniques, brought some of the best make-up brushes to the high street’s price point, and their video tutorials have racked up millions and millions of views on YouTube (no surprise considering how knowledgeable and fun they are to watch).  Rebecca Fearn  Jana Otte  Who  Beauty journalist, Rebecca Fearn.   Why  A beauty writer, make-up addict and fragrance enthusiast by trade, London-based Becky has a few years’ experience as a beauty insider under her belt. On #BDoesBeauty, she shares her industry knowledge, tips and reviews, as well as the can’t-live-without products that you’ll love too. As well as all things make-up, hair and skincare, she also writes about social issues and current affairs from time to time. A great read.  BeautyAndStyleEdit.com (AKA BASE)   Who:  Fashion stylist Abisoye Odugbesan.  Why:  Maybe you wouldn’t ordinarily think of turning to a fashion stylist for beauty advice but BASE proves exactly why you should. Having worked in the fashion industry for nearly a decade, Abi felt frustrated at the lack of inclusive beauty content addressing all skin tones and hair types. So she developed BASE, to do just that. In just under a year, BASE has already become a go-to destination for women who want a good dose of beauty with a helping of style. There’s plenty of product reviews, interviews and, of course, drool-worthy shoots, to get your hands on.   Madeleine Loves    Who   Beauty editor and product addict Madeleine Spencer.  Why  Beauty obsessive Madeleine has created a one-stop-shop with her newly redesigned Madeleine Loves . From product reviews, book recommendations, fashion titbits, travel suggestions and video tutorials, she’s got you covered. We particularly love ‘The Panic Station’ which addresses mental health and is where Madeleine shares her experience of anxiety. There’s something for everyone.  Sali Hughes Beauty   Who  Make-up artist and Guardian Weekend columnist Sali Hughes.  Why   Sali’s no-nonsense approach to beauty talk makes her someone worth listening to. Author of two beauty bibles, Pretty Honest and Pretty Iconic , she’s much-loved by her readers thanks to her honest opinions and practical advice. And her ‘In The Bathroom With…’ video series is genius. Watch them.  Lisa Eldridge   Who  World-renowned make-up artist Lisa Eldridge.  Why  It’s not just the A-List clientele that has us logging-in repeatedly to Lisa Eldridge’s website – her videos are something that are quite simply not to be missed. Expect a good mix of celebrity ‘Get The Look Features’ like Kendall Jenner’s smoky eyes, to a series of tutorials that cater to the basics from ‘Make-up for Glasses’, to how to get ‘Natural, Flawless Skin’ and – our favourite – ‘Meeting Up With The Ex’ where Lisa demonstrates how to minimise the appearance of puffy ‘cried through the night’ eyes. There’s even the odd cameo by Alexa Chung. You can’t help but learn a thing or two with Lisa and her new book Face Paint: The Story Of Make-Up is a must-have too.  Into The Gloss   Who  Blogger turned business mogul Emily Weiss.  Why  If you do just one thing today make sure it’s logging on to Into The Gloss and checking out The Top Shelf. It will quickly become your lunchtime ritual. ITG began as the brainchild of Emily Weiss (the ‘Super Intern’ from reality TV programme ‘The Hills’). Originally a simple beauty blog, ITG has gone on to become an international business but, despite its crazy success, the site is as much of a joy to read now as it was when it was first launched. The Top Shelf is our favourite feature that takes a nosy into the bathroom cabinets and beauty hoards of some of our favourite well known women. And did we mention she’s the founder of that cult beauty brand, Glossier …?  Huda Beauty    Who   American-born, award-winning beauty blogger and Hollywood-trained make-up artist Huda Kattan, now based in Dubai, UAE. She is the face of HudaBeauty and has since launched her eponymous make-up line of the same name (think the fullest coverage foundation, eye palettes to die for and one of the world’s best lipstick kits, ever).  Why  She’s the queen of YouTube and Instagram beauty-blogging, plus she’s a global beauty mega star and incredibly astute business woman, who has more than 1.5M YouTube subscribers and an impressive 15.9M Instagram followers and 72.6K Twitter followers.  Farah Dhukai    Who   This 28 year-old beauty blogger is from Toronto, Canada and studied cosmetology science at Aveda, before starting her YouTube channel six years ago.  Why  She has 1.3M YouTube subscribers, 4.1M Instagram followers and 33.5K Twitter followers. She also has beauty range, Farsali, with her husband. Consider her the big sister every girl needs advising on DIY beauty, hair and make-up.  Nikkie Tutorials    Who   Nikkie de Jager is fun, zany and an incredibly skilled make-up artist, hailing from the Netherlands.  Why           She creates a base that makes your skin look like it has a photoshop finish. Her collaboration with Too Faced cosmetics saw the release of cult favourite product, The Power of Make-up Palette by NikkieTutorials. Jaclyn Hill   Who  She’s the 26 year-old make-up artist and beauty blogger from America who started her YouTube channel in 2011 and collaborated with Becca cosmetics to produced the hugely popular Champagne Pop highlighter. Why Jaclyn has 3.7m YouTube subscribers, 3.4m Instagram followers and 697.5K Twitter followers . Reading now              Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros.

Hills     September 28, 2018 2:41 pm                  James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       'I love my Italian nose.'  Before Lady Gaga was Lady Gaga, she was Stephanie Germanotta. And Stephanie Germanotta was told she needed to get a nose job, if she ever wanted to make it big as a singer. During a recent interview, Lady Gaga revealed that she had drawn on her own negative experiences in the music industry for her performance in A Star Is Born. It makes sense, given that she plays a singer at the start of her own music journey.  She told The Mirror , ‘Before my first single ever came out it was suggested I get a nose job but I said ‘No.’ I love my Italian nose.’   And we’re glad she did, TBH. Gaga is without a doubt one of the most original performers of the past decade and it’s insane that anybody would have told her that to begin with.  James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock  In fact, being told she should get a nose job wasn’t the only thing she was told to do if she wanted to make it big and she made a habit of continually telling people no.  ‘If people wanted me to look like a sexpot I would look like the opposite,’ she said. ‘If they said ‘Try dancing and looking this way’ I would always flip it on its head and do it my way.’  The Latest               Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros. UK       This is why you should care about Nagini in Fantastic Beasts                 James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       Lady Gaga was told to get a nose job when she was first starting out                       Hot List: Here’s what’s new in your favourite stores and online this week       Sharethrough (Mobile)         Although Lady Gaga has now racked up numerous albums, Grammy wins and number one hits and you’d think she would never think about those naysayers again, she delved into her past for her new acting role. Her character in the film, Ally, appears to be the complete opposite of Gaga – a person who is beaten down by the industry and has little confidence until somebody else helps raise her up.             She said, ‘”I really believed in myself when I started out pounding on doors to break down all of the barriers in the music industry, I really had courage. [Ally] doesn’t have that, she’s not brave and she’s not full of self-confidence.’ Lady Gaga stars in A Star Is Born alongside Bradley Cooper, who also directed the film. The film hits UK cinemas on October 5. Reading now              Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros.

Tinder is still on top as the most popular of all the best sex apps , and 2017 has seen the numbers of Tinder’s paid users rocketing to 476,000 singletons subscribing for premium access. We’re expecting an even bigger spike during winter’s cuffing season . And now the Tinder experience is about to jump from our phones to our physical lives, thanks to the genius of AI technology.  Greg Blatt, the CEO of Tinder’s parent company and one of the best online dating sites , Match, has announced exciting new features that he promises to ‘blur the lines between the physical and digital worlds for dating.’ After the success of Tinder Gold – which lets you pay to see who swiped right on you – the new features expected to hit Tinder in early 2018 include AI and geolocation functions allowing users to fully immerse themselves into the activities of the people they’ve already been matched with. He said, ‘Until now, Tinder has basically been a swiping machine – it’s effective and simple but ultimately limited.’   The introduction of Tinder’s AI-assisted dating function is being kept firmly under wraps but it has got everyone talking. Though the jury is still out as to whether wearing an AI headset on a virtual first date could be the key to finding true love or the biggest passion killer since halitosis.  These latest Tinder updates come after a long line of game-changing extra functions in the last few years, including the development of Tinder online so that you can literally swipe anywhere. Here’s everything else you need to know about Tinder and how to maximise it.      Research shows that there are 50 million active users on Tinder who check their accounts 11 times per day and spend an average of 90 minutes per day on the app. And if you’re all too familiar with the perils of Tinder, we’ve charted the 12 most soul-destroying things about internet dating . But, if all of this means nothing to you, then here’s everything you need to know about the dating app everyone is talking about. The Latest               Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald / Warner Bros. UK       This is why you should care about Nagini in Fantastic Beasts                 James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock       Lady Gaga was told to get a nose job when she was first starting out                       Hot List: Here’s what’s new in your favourite stores and online this week       Sharethrough (Mobile)        What is Tinder? It’s an online dating app. When it first came onto the scene, it was used more as a hook-up/no strings sex app because it finds you potential matches based on their proximity to you. But now almost everyone seems to be on it. How does Tinder work? It finds your location using GPS, then uses your Facebook information to create your profile but don’t worry – nothing about Tinder will ever be posted to Facebook. Your Tinder profile is made up of your first name, age, photos of your choice and any pages you’ve ‘liked’ on Facebook. You can also include your education and occupation in your bio. Tinder then finds you potential matches near your location (you can narrow it down by age and distance, too) and if they take your fancy, you swipe right to ‘like’ them. If not, go left to ‘pass’. If they’ve also ‘liked’ you – then bingo, it’s a match and you can start messaging. Can you use Tinder without Facebook? The short answer to this is sadly, no. You need a Facebook profile to be able to use the app. Can you use Tinder online? Yes. Thanks to an update, we have Tinder Online which you can now use on any device – including your laptop or, dare we say it, work computer. So if you need a break from spreadsheets and fancy a scroll, it’s totally possible without being glued to your phone. Perfect. How to create the perfect Tinder profile   We know what you’re thinking: how on earth are we meant to create the perfect Tinder profile (right-swipeable obvs) to lure in our soul mate?  A new algorithm alternates the photo first seen by others when you show up on Tinder and notes each response to put your best foot – or picture – forward to new people. Clever right?  It has seen a 12% increase in matches. So spend less time ordering your pics, and more time swiping for Mr or Mrs Right.   Just remember according to a new study by the University of Iowa, the secret to success on dating apps comes down to making sure that your profile pictures aren’t all too pristine.  Those pictures that are perfectly posed and highly filtered were deemed less socially attractive and less trustworthy, so the more natural your photos the better.  It showed that you’re better off presenting your actual self rather than your idealised self if you want to attract a date. Doing otherwise, the study explains, ‘might be coded as bragging, which is associated with negative social consequences and reduced liking.’  Another study also found that people wearing glasses in their profile picture were much less likely to get a right swipe. And a recent Reddit thread revealed that the phrase you should never use in your Tinder profile is: ‘I made this account as a joke’. Makes sense, right? The other tip was: don’t state the obvious. ‘Love travelling, cheese and wine’ and ‘I enjoy nights out as much as nights in’ are not likely to get you a match. Must do better.   How to get more matches on Tinder We had a chat with Rosette Pambakian, Tinder’s VP of Comms and the woman who helped launch the world’s most successful dating app, to ask how to get a swipe right every time. Here are her top tips. Stop pouting and start smiling ‘A lot of people think their serious, hot photo is going to get them a lot of swipes, but we’ve found that when you’re authentically smiling it actually increases your chances of getting a swipe right by 14%.’ Keep group photos to a minimum ‘I like seeing who someone’s friends are because I think that says a lot about a person, but one group photo is enough – don’t make it your first photo, and certainly not all of them.’ Don’t neglect your bio ‘As a guy, you’re 98 per cent more likely to not get swiped right if you don’t have your bio filled out. Girls like reading and if you don’t take the time to tell us a little bit about yourself that says a lot.’ Integrate your Instagram ‘It’s a great way to keep your profile fresh, and give your potential matches insight into who you are.’ Get your pet involved ‘You need a talking point – activity photos, like skiing or surfing, are good talking points. And pets always seem to do well. Who doesn’t like an animal?’ Don’t let matches get stale ‘It’s best to send messages instead of leaving that match idle. Say something interesting about something you saw on their profile. I have a huge owl in one of my photos and it’s 90 per cent of the time the thing they comment on!’ Be authentic ‘Spend time chatting with your match to see if you guys are really going to be compatible – then you should have a good sense of whether you’re going to hit it off when you meet in person.’ What is Tinder social? For those who want a wingwoman, this is for you. This option allows you to meet potential dates in a group situation as you can invite your friends too – way less awkward. What is Tinder gold? A members-only subscription service that costs around £4 per month and allows you to see everyone who has swiped right on you. Genius, right? It also allows you unlimited likes – and crucially, the power to undo them – and the passport feature allows you to like anyone anywhere in the world. It’s basically Tinder at its maximum. And worth the fee. What is Tinder Boost? Feeling like you’re not quite getting the Tinder love you used to? Well, that could be about to change thanks to Tinder Boost. Yes, with a name that does exactly what it says on the tin, the new Tinder update gives your profile a push in the right direction – boosting you up to be one of the top profiles in your area for 30 minutes. This results in x10 profile views and more chance of a match. Winning. ‘Boost mode’ can only be activated while swiping in Tinder mode. If you have upgraded to Tinder Plus, you will get one free Boost every month. If you become insatiable and want more, or if you don’t have Tinder Plus, simply buy a Boost any time you like. Tinder Boost has launched worldwide and the premise is: be seen by more people, get more matches. It really is that simple.  Celebrities on Tinder It even seems that some of our favourite celebs are happily swiping away. Thought that guy you swiped left for bore an uncanny resemblance to your favourite Hollywood celeb? Well, it just might have been your A-List beloved – particularly if his or her name sat next to a little blue tick. Yes, Tinder has introduced verified profiles for “notable public figures, celebrities and athletes” – much like Twitter and Facebook. Alongside the likes of Leondardo DiCaprio, Dave Franco and Hilary Duff, Betches recently discovered that Coach Carr from Mean Girls has also joined the popular online dating app – and his profile is SO fetch. Dwayne Hill, who found fame in the 2004 comedy starring Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams, describes himself as a 6’5 Emmy-nominated actor. Adding ‘if you’re a good cuddler, I might let you join my gang’ in his bio. Dwayne can been seen sporting a fully fledged beard and man bun in his pictures, though with the possibility of  a Mean Girls sequel on the cards he might not want to ditch the tracksuit just yet. Would you swipe right? What’s good about Tinder? It’s instant No agonising over a profile for hours. You can be up and running in about a minute. Mutual friends The mutual friends function means people almost come with references – if you’ve got 10 Facebook friends in common with a match, chances are you could be on to a winner. In addition to common friends, Tinder now shows you when you and your match are in the same social circle, too. Easy to use The app’s designed for mobile users, and it shows. The layout’s clear and it’s simple to use. Perfect to fill minutes when you’re waiting for the bus. Embarrassment factor is limited Say you ‘like’ a Jamie Dornan-esque hottie. He’ll never know, unless he ‘likes’ you too. No unsolicited emails On most dating sites, anyone can message you. But with Tinder, only someone you’ve ‘liked’ can make contact. What’s bad about Tinder? Stale matches We’ve found it’s rare for guys to actually start up a conversation once they’ve matched with you, leaving you with lots of matches and not much else. Casual hook-ups not long-term love It is still very casual sex-focussed. Many men are only on Tinder for a quick hook-up, so if it’s a serious relationship you’re after this app might not be for you. Hard to focus The game-style of Tinder means it’s really easy to keep playing and forget about that hottie you were messaging yesterday. If you’re serious about finding someone, you’ll need to stay focussed. It’s addictive You have been warned.  Top tips for using Tinder:  The best times to use Tinder are Spring and Autumn, according to online dating coach Ivana Franekova. She calls this the ‘hunting season.’  Mix up your photos. Tinder allows you to have six photos. Make sure these show you have a full and interesting life.  Try and be creative with your messages. Don’t just say ‘hey’ – you need to stand out.  Be on the look out for clues about height. On Tinder, age is the only vital stat you get, so it can be a bit of a height lottery.  Be safe. It goes without saying, but, if you do go on a Tinder date, let someone know where you are and always meet in a public place.  Beware of Tinder scams A new problem facing Tinder is a wave of scams. The latest one involves being messaged by what seems like a match, who’ll then ask you if you’re verified on Tinder, and tell you that in order to be verified you just need to click a link and enter a code. The ‘verification’ service is actually a porn website and will charge you £90 after you enter your credit card details for ‘age verification.’ Which definitely wasn’t what you wanted. Bad Tinder dates Of course, once you’ve met your match there isn’t a 100% guarantee that you will get on like a house on fire. Best case scenario? You’ll mutually agree you’d be ‘better off as a friends’ after one drink and call it a night. Worst case scenario? See below… Relationship and dating writer Lauren Crouch, who runs a Tumblr blog entitled ‘ No Bad Dates Just Good Stories’ , has outlined a recent encounter she had with a man she met on Tinder. The two met at a tube station (she wanted to meet at a pub but he said no). After refusing to go to a nice independent coffee shop because he had to cross the road, the man insisted on going to Costa (who said romance was dead?), then invited her round for dinner. Lauren quite reasonably declined, as they had only just met. He then said he had to go home to be there for his Ocado delivery. It could have ended there and been just another disastrous Tinder date to write off. But then things took a turn for the worse, as you can see in the text exchanges below (Lauren’s are in blue). What are the most popular jobs on Tinder? In September 2016, Tinder revealed the most right swiped jobs on the app i.e. the professions which gained the most interest from prospective dates. And the result? Well according the research, teaching is the most right swiped for females and lawyers were top for males. See the rest of the list, below:     Enough to put you off Tinder? Here are 11 of the best online dating sites for you to try out. However if you’re committed to the original hook-up app, then enjoy it. Have fun coming up with flirty/hilarious opening lines, picking your most natural pics for all those swipe rights, and let the fun begin. But when meeting a match, always remember to be safe.

That said, there are some products that I always ensure are in stock – Bobbi Brown Creamy Corrector , Windle and Moodie Invisible Day & Night Cream and Origins Super Spot Remover are a few of my must-haves at all times.   Continuing this theme, there is one conditioning treatment I always make sure is in my shower to nourish and tame my unruly, frizzy hair. In terms of the best hair conditioners, this is The One.  After using this product is the only time my hair has resembles anything remotely like Kate Middleton’s. It’s super bouncy without that weighed down, heavy feeling that using multiple styling products would leave, because it’s applied to wet hair before shampooing, so any excess not absorbed by the hair is washed away.  I am, of course, talking about the one and only Elasticizer by legendary hair stylist and trichologist, Philip Kingsley. And, given that one is sold every two minutes, I’m certainly not alone in my opinion of how great it is.

It was originally created for Audrey Hepburn about 40 years ago to remedy the damage to her hair caused by years of on-set styling, so you can be sure it’s a good one.
